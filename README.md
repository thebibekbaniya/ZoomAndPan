## How To Use 
* Sign into your GitHub account, or create a free GitHub account if you don't have one.
* "fork" the repo by clicking the Fork button in the upper right corner. This creates a copy of the project repository in your GitHub account.
* While still in your repository, click the green Clone or download button and then copy the HTTPS URL. ```git clone https://github.com/[your username]/ZoomAndPan.git```
* Check that your fork is the "origin" remote. If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it. To view, ```git remote -v``` and to add, ```git remote add origin https://github.com/[your username]/ZoomAndPan.git```
* Add the project repository as the "upstream" remote. ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/thebibekbaniya/ZoomAndPan.git```
* Before you start making any changes to your local files, it's a good practice to first synchronize your local repository with the project repository. ```git pull upstream main```
* Rather than making changes to the project's "main" branch, it's a good practice to instead create your own branch. This creates an environment for your work that is isolated from the main branch. ```git checkout -b [your username]_[purpose of pull]```
* Use a text editor or IDE to make the changes you planned to the files in your local repository. Because you checked out a branch in the previous step, any edits you make will only affect that branch. 
* After you make a set of changes, use git add -A to stage your changes and git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES" to commit them. To add files ```git add -A ``` and to commit  ```git commit -m "[Description of Changes]"```
* When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using git push origin BRANCH_NAME. This "pushes" your changes to the "BRANCH_NAME" branch of the "origin" (which is your fork on GitHub). ```git push origin [your username]_[purpose of pull]```

``` 
git clone https://github.com/[your username]/ZoomAndPan.git
cd ZoomAndPan
git remote -v
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your username]/ZoomAndPan.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thebibekbaniya/ZoomAndPan.git
git remote -v
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b [your username]_[purpose of pull]
git branch
git add -A
git commit -m "[Description of Changes]"
git push origin [your username]_[purpose of pull]
```
